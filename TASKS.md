## Active Tasks

---

[DONE][HIGH] Feature: Region Comparison Panel
  Description: The Zustand store already has `compareMode`, `comparedCountries`, `addComparedCountry`,
    and `removeComparedCountry`. When compareMode is active, render a dual-column panel inside
    RegionPanel showing key stats (event count by category, heat score summary, recent events)
    side-by-side for up to 2 countries. Add a "Compare" toggle button to the RegionPanel header.
  Description: The compare UI structure (toggle button, CompareCard component, dual-column grid)
    was already in RegionPanel. Added the missing pieces: category event breakdown (24h, by count)
    and recent events list to CompareCard. CompareCard now reads events from Zustand store directly
    and computes country-filtered events via compareMatchesCountry helper. Imports CATEGORY_COLOR,
    CATEGORY_ICON, CATEGORY_LABEL from categoryConfig.
  Success Criteria: Met — compare mode shows side-by-side cards with stats, category breakdown,
    and recent events; exits cleanly on ✕ or compare toggle; no new TS errors.

[TODO][MEDIUM] Feature: Event Density Clustering
  Description: EventMarkers currently renders one marker per event regardless of zoom level,
    leading to overlapping icons when many events share a small geographic area. At low zoom
    (solar / high-orbital distance), group markers within ~200 km radius into a single cluster
    marker showing count. At surface zoom, show individual markers.
  Success Criteria: Clustered markers appear at low zoom; expand to individual markers as user
    zooms in. No visible regression to existing single-marker behaviour at surface zoom.
  Retry Count: 0

[DONE][MEDIUM] UI: Timeline Filter Slider
  Description: Added `timeRangeFilter` ('6h'|'12h'|'24h'|'all') to Zustand store. Rendered a
    segmented button group in CategoryFilterBar (left of category chips). EventStack filters events
    by published_at cutoff before applying the category filter. No new TS errors.
  Success Criteria: Met — user switches 6h/12h/24h/All, EventStack updates accordingly. State in store.
  Retry Count: 0

---

[DONE][MEDIUM] Feature: High-Intensity Toast Notifications
  Description: Created ToastContainer component that detects new CRITICAL/HIGH events via store
    event diffing (skips first load). Each toast shows category icon, intensity label, and title
    snippet. Auto-dismisses after 3s with slide-out animation; manually dismissible. Multiple
    toasts stack in bottom-right corner. Mounted in App.tsx outside HUD scale layer.
  Success Criteria: Met — CRITICAL/HIGH events trigger toast; auto-dismiss 3s; stacking; no new TS errors.
  Retry Count: 0

[DONE][MEDIUM] Feature: Event Source Reliability Labels
  Description: Added `reliability` (HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|UNVERIFIED) field end-to-end:
    - `schema.sql`: new column + runtime ALTER TABLE migration for existing DBs
    - `types.ts`: `SourceReliability` type added to Article, OllamaClassification, ClientEvent
    - `ollama.ts`: system prompt updated, validateClassification parses + defaults UNVERIFIED
    - `sqlite.ts`: markAnalyzed saves reliability; articleToClientEvent maps it
    - `retention.ts`: baseHeatScore dummy object includes reliability
    - Client types + EventPanelBody badge (color-coded: green/gold/orange/dim)
  Success Criteria: Met — new articles get reliability; badge in panel; UNVERIFIED for old rows; no TS errors.

[DONE][LOW] Feature: i18n Complete Coverage
  Description: Expanded en.json / zh-TW.json from ~20 keys to 40+ keys covering all major UI areas:
    panel actions (focus, focus_region, region), event labels (heat, source, suggestedQueries, agent,
    analyzing, viewSource, askAgent), time range filter (6h/12h/24h/all), region section labels, and
    ui controls (liteMode, normalMode, immersive, aiAnalysis, config, compareMode, canvas.toggle,
    celestialNav.collapse/expand). Updated EventPanelBody and CategoryFilterBar to use t() for all
    visible labels.
  Success Criteria: Met — all major visible strings are keyed; switching language changes panel and
    toolbar labels; no new TS errors.
  Retry Count: 0

## Completed Tasks

[DONE][HIGH] UI: Heat Score Visualization
  Description: Added heat-score bar + numeric value + expiry label to EventPanelBody. Added
    heat score badge (value + HEAT label) to EventStack hover tooltip. Color-coded by intensity
    (red ≥1.5, amber ≥1.0, cyan ≥0.5, blue ≥0.3, dim <0.3). Expiry derived from `expires_at`
    timestamp if available, otherwise from heat_score tiers.
  Success Criteria: Met — bar and expiry visible in EventPanelBody; badge in tooltip; no new TS errors.
  Retry Count: 0

---

[DONE][HIGH] Feature: AIS Ship Tracking Layer
  Description: Added `/api/tracking/ships` server proxy using Node 22 native WebSocket to
    aisstream.io (requires `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` env var; returns [] gracefully if unset).
    Added `useShipsLayer` / `ShipState` to `useTrackingLayers.ts`. Wired `TrackingLayer.tsx`
    to render `ShipMarker` for each vessel. Enabled FloatDock ships button with green colour.
    Added `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` entry to `.env.example`.
  Success Criteria: Met — ships toggle button functional; server returns [] without key; TS clean.
